<h6>salar jung museum</h6>

<p>The Salar Jung Museum possesses a good number of clocks collected from different European countries such
 as France, England, Switzerland, Germany, Holland etc. The variety includes the Bird cage clocks, 
 Bracket clocks, Grandfather clocks, Skeleton clocks, etc. The museum is also having some good examples 
 of the clocks of the <b>contemporary</b> period of Louis XV, Louis XVI, and <b>Napoleon</b> 1st of France. The most 
 important clock which attracts the greatest number of visitors every day is, however, a British Bracket
 clock. It has got a mechanical device by which a miniature toy figure comes out of an enclosure and 
 strikes the gong and then returns to the enclosure at each hour</p>
