     <p>Abhiram is the youngest son of London-based businessman Subrahmanyam, who quits his job and starts his own company, 
        K.M.C Pipes and Canals and he completes his company's first project in Spain.
         He learns that his father is suffering from pancreatic cancer and has roughly a month or more to live. 
         Subrahmanyam reveals his name as Ramesh Chandra Prasad, who was once London's richest entrepreneur,
          who lost all his wealth because of a cunning man, Krishna Murthy Kautilya,

           He was then forced to change his name to Subrahmanyam and got rich again after years of work.
